# Team Dynamics
Our group worked together to apply object-oriented analysis, design, and implementation principles in a project, to design an effective system in the least amount of time and remain successful in  building a modular, extensible, and maintainable application. All of us communicated through Outlook's system to clarify each other's questions and to get together in the GitHub's Projects. This project management tool helped us manage tasks, communicate, and resolve conflicts. The whole progression and distribution of work display proved to be useful for the clarity of intentions and tracking of changes. In the future group projects we could've improved the project management by utilizing more priority assignments and labeling tasks accordingly, while constructing the tasks themselves with no place to be divided into even smaller pieces to promote faster updates on everyone's progress. Another possible upgrade in future communications in groups is to change Outlook for something more suitable for team discussions.
