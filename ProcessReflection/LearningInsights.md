# Learning Insights
Our group learned the whole process of designing and implementing object-oriented principles and design patterns in a system throughout our work on the project.
* We learned how to initiate the design process right with the MVC design pattern as an example of what to look for in the structure of the project while figuring out its major subsystems.
* Assigning the right responsibilities to the correct classes became much easier with the introduction of the sequence diagrams.
* Designing the classes as a process proved to be more clear with the introduction of class diagrams.
* Designing for safety and security became more straightforward as we've analysed what can compromise the safety and security of the system, and what can we do to prevent it.
* We learned how evaluating the quality of the software design can help the project progress unobstructed.
* All of the design patterns we've learned helped us implement a system through organization of principles that restrict how the project can be implemented, but opens up possibilities for its future extension, makes it more scalable, and surprisingly more flexible, despite any limitations.
* The concept of designing for reuse sparked new ideas for effective design and implementation.

All in all this group project was productive for all of us to enhance our knowledge and skills in the field of software design and development.
